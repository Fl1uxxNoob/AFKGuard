## Overview

AFKGuard is a comprehensive plugin for Minecraft servers that detects, manages, and prevents abuse by AFK (Away From Keyboard) players. The plugin provides customizable detection methods, verification systems, and administrative tools to ensure a fair and active server environment.

## Features

  - Simple: Basic detection of player movement
  - Advanced: Sophisticated detection considering minimal movements, camera rotation, and more
- **Customizable Thresholds**:
  - Minimum movement distance
  - Camera rotation sensitivity
  - AFK trigger timeout

### üîî Notification System
- Broadcast AFK status changes to all players (optional)
- Customizable messages with color support

### üëÆ Verification System
- Random verification prompts for AFK players
- GUI-based verification: click the correct block to verify
- The correct block changes position randomly each time
- Configurable verification timeout with auto-kick option

### ‚öôÔ∏è Management Features
- Automatic AFK marking after configurable inactivity period
- AFK command for manual AFK toggling
- Option to kick AFK players after extended periods
- Designated AFK area teleportation
- Command blocking for AFK players (with whitelist)

  interval: 450          # Seconds between verifications
  chance: 65             # Probability of verification (0-100)
  timeout: 60            # Seconds to respond before kick
  # UI customization options...

# AFK area coordinates (when use-afk-area is true)
afk-area:
  world: "world"
  x: 0
  y: 100
  z: 0
  yaw: 0
  pitch: 0

# Messages customization
messages:
  prefix: "&7[&bAFK&fGuard&7] "
  # Various messages...
```

### settings.yml
```yaml
# Detailed AFK detection thresholds
detection:
  advanced:
    min-movement-distance: 0.05
    max-small-movement: 2.0
    min-camera-yaw: 5.0
    min-camera-pitch: 5.0
  simple:
    consider-rotation: false
```

## Installation

1. Download the plugin JAR file
2. Place it in your server's `plugins` folder
3. Restart your server
4. Edit the configuration files as needed in `plugins/AFKGuard/`
5. Use `/afk reload` to apply changes

## Database

AFKGuard uses an embedded SQLite database to track all AFK-related events. The database is automatically created and managed by the plugin, with tables for:

- Auto-AFK events
- AFK kicks
- AFK teleports

You can query this data using the `/afk history` command.

## Permissions

- `afkguard.bypass` - Players with this permission will not be marked as AFK automatically and will not be verified
- `afkguard.admin` - Access to admin commands (check, reload, history)
